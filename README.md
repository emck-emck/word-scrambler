This is a Python script that takes a sentence given by the user and scrambles it.
I made this in May 2022. It took me an hour or so.

For example if one runs "python scrambler.py this is a sentence", the program will print:
siht si a eeetnscn
to the command line (for example, it scrambles randomly of course).

Why did I make this? I wanted to play a joke on some friends so I decided that it was easier to write a program to scramble the sentences for me than to write each one manually.
